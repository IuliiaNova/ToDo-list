# ToDo list with REACT

To start this progect we will need:

- install REACT with "create-react-app"
- install uuid with "npm i uuid" (it will help us to create id for our items)
- install randomColor with "npm i randomcolor" (to add a background color for our elements)
- install draggable with "npm i react-draggable" (to move our element all over our screen)

## What can we do with this app?

1. We can create a "task" writing it in input and then press button "enter" or enter on your keyboard (it was activated with "e.which");
2. You can change the position of your task-element just press-hold and move it where you want
3. You can delete any task you want
4. If you refresh you navigator - donÂ´t worry, all data are saved in localSrotage
